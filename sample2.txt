We believe gen AI is a core competency that needs to be underpinned with strong, foundational technology platforms, a
robust governance and oversight function, and a flexible exploration/experimentation access model. This is not only to
realize the benefits rapidly from the use cases identified above, but also to help automakers manage costs, ensure security
and safeguard intellectual property. We therefore recommend the following steps for automakers, as they develop a clear
strategy around gen AI.
Guiding principles for deploying a gen AI strategy
Automakers must invest in understanding the gen AI technology�s capabilities and evaluate the benefits it can offer their
businesses. This may require identifying specific functions and use cases that could benefit from gen AI. To strike the right
balance between risk and demand in gen AI use case deployment, OEMs can follow these guiding principles:
� Start with low risk and high demand use cases: Begin with use cases that have high demand and minimal risk, to
understand the capabilities and limitations of language models within the automotive business context. Gradually,
expand to more complex scenarios as confidence and experience grow. Many use cases, as mentioned before, can be
a good starting point of a gen AI journey. We have seen auto organizations trying to improve the effectiveness of internal
process, enable automation, and improve customer experience since it is inexpensive to create a framework to supervise
the output of gen AI in such scenarios. Examples could be use cases such as agent-assistive capabilities for contact
centers, knowledge management, and content creation and translation.
� Select the right tools and platforms: As OEMs have already invested in AI, they need to appreciate that gen AI will
complement their existing AI initiatives and will help them realize greater business value. Several existing tools and
platforms have integrated AI into their products such as Salesforce Einstein and Microsoft 365 Copilot. But these tools do
not achieve the full potential of gen AI. To unlock the full potential, OEMs must invest in capabilities which span across
essential applications.
� Adopt a collaborative approach: Gen AI requires a truly diverse set of skills to be implemented successfully. Organizations
should collaborate with stakeholders such as customer and dealer representatives, data scientists, legal experts, in
addition to IT specialists. Organizations should also foster collaboration and communication to ensure a comprehensive
assessment of risks and demand.
� Use iterative deployment: Adopt an iterative approach, continuously evaluating the performance, impact, and risks
associated with language models. Implement feedback loops and mechanisms to address issues, refine processes and
improve outcomes over time.
� Training and support: Develop a comprehensive training program to upskill the workforce on gen AI technologies. This is
crucial in an area as new as gen AI. Today, the skills required to activate a strategy simply do not exist at scale.
Selecting the right partner
It is critical that automakers select the right partner as they embark on a gen AI journey. Any organization that you partner
with should bring insights into your business from other OEMs, tier 1 suppliers, dealers and automotive
technology companies.
